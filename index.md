# Nick Wade

My goal at any company is finding technical solutions to business problems. I have a affinity for CICD, automation, and general SRE work. I love learning new technologies, meeting new people, and finding out why I’m wrong. I’ve got experience working with everything from embedded Linux systems to Kubernetes clusters.

## Currently

I am a Software Development Engineer at GoDaddy, working on internal tools and operations. I help maintain/improve a variety of tools and APIs, everything from customer support tools to automated refund software. Our tools are built upon a C#/React/NodeJS software stack, CICD done with Jenkins, deployed on-top of a on-premise Kubernetes cluster.
